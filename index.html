                <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
                <p>Becoming a web developer involves learning programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites and web applications. You can specialize in front-end development (user interface), back-end development (server-side logic), or full-stack development (both). Key skills include working with frameworks (React, Node.js), databases, and version control (Git). Continuous learning and hands-on projects help in mastering web development and securing job opportunities.</p>
